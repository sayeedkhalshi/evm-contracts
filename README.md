This repository is to test how social media can be built over smart contract. For the actual project where this is being integrated is learnea repository. Remember is a very large project and social features haven't been implemented there. We have high gas fee issues and we are working on that.

Our 2nd idea is to deploy it on FHE based testnet for privacy related contents.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
